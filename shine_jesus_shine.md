# Shine, Jesus, shine!

Lord the light of your love is shining,
in the midst of the darkness shining,
Jesus light of the world shine upon us,
set us free by the truth you now bring us,
shine on me, shine on me.

Shine, Jesus, shine
fill this land with the Father's glory,
blaze, Spirit, blaze
set our hearts on fire,
flow, river, flow
flood the nations with grace and mercy,
send forth your word, Lord
and let there be light.

Lord I come to your awesome presence
from the shadows into your radiance,
by the blood I may enter your brightness
search me,try me, consume all my darkness,
shine on me, shine on me.

As we gaze on your kingly brightness,
so our faces display your likeness,
ever changing from glory to glory,
mirrored here may our lives tell your story,
shine on me, shine on me.
