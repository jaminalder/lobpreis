# As the mountains are around Jerusalem

As the mountains are around Jerusalem.
The Lord is all around His people.
As the mountains are around Jerusalem.
The Lord is all around His people.

From this time forth and forevermore.
The Lord is all around His people.

From this time forth, it shall always be.
The Lord is all around His people.

Like mount Zion in the midst of Jerusalem.
We can not be moved, we can not be moved.
Like mount Zion in the midst of Jerusalem.
We can not be moved, we can not be moved.
